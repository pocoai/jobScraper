        "description": "\n<h2><strong>Company description</strong></h2>\n<p>Radix Trading is a proprietary firm focused on quantitative research and scientific trading. We\u2019re one of the most active liquidity providers on electronic exchanges globally, and have leveraged a culture of open, collaborative innovation to scale the reach of our ideas and pace of iteration, without having to scale our headcount (currently, we\u2019re around 125 people across Chicago, New York, and Amsterdam).</p>\n<p>In our industry, the vast majority of ideas will fail. So, since inception, we\u2019ve focused on continuous enhancement of our automated research platform and cutting-edge technology, allowing us to fail faster than the day prior, glean insights from each idea, and leverage individual contributions to the fullest across our entire organization.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We\u2019re led by Ben Blander and Michael Rauchman, who played key roles in the rise of electronic trading, but both recognized a major gap in the industry \u2014 a true focus on research processes coupled with an open organizational structure that fosters collaboration.\u00a0</p>\n<h2><strong>Job description</strong></h2>\n<p>As a Quantitative Researcher, your focus is on furthering the ML developments of the firm and identifying trading opportunities, but you can add even more value with strong quantitative skills and some coding proficiency to accelerate the innovation process and help others leverage your work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As you get going, you\u2019ll gain new knowledge and insight into the fundamentals of market dynamics, trading strategies, and our proprietary research platform. We\u2019ve stripped away the boundaries of what you can access and touch internally, so while you learn the intricacies of our industry, you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to contribute and directly affect our bottom line within your first few weeks on the team.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><u>While interest in trading is key, a background in finance is definitely not.</u> Our team is built mostly from academia \u2014 professors, postdocs, and PhDs \u2014 not from other trading firms.\u00a0 We seek mental diversity and add a select group of academics each year from a wide range of disciplines. In the last year new associates joined after completing academic commitments at MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Oxford, Princeton, UChicago, IAS, Columbia, and UPenn.</p>\n<p>COMPENSATION \u2013 Competitive salary, plus quarterly bonus based on individual performance and contribution towards success of others and the firm.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why trading?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you want to get near-immediate feedback on your best ideas, while leveraging cutting-edge technology, the trading industry is hard to beat. Every day we\u2019re competing with some of the smartest, most driven people in the world trying to take our money -- and if we don\u2019t stay at the very top of our game in research, technology, and economics, they will.</p>\n<p>And while the highly-publicized wave of high-frequency or \u201cflash\u201d trading based on sheer speed of execution might have reached its limit, we see continued opportunities with our strategy of using statistical research to outsmart the competition.</p>\n<h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2>\n<p>We\u2019re looking for highly analytical people (math, physics, computer science, statistics, electrical engineering, etc.) who want to help build the research-driven trading firm of the future. To do that, you\u2019ll need the following qualities:</p>\n<p>&gt; PhD+ with experience with machine learning, deep learning, reinforcment learning\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt; Persistent Drive to Improve - Do you have an innate desire to rise to the next level, even after great accomplishment? Our people have been very successful in their academic careers and are joining Radix to make even more impact.</p>\n<p>&gt; Creative Problem Solving and Probabilistic Thinking - You must enjoy learning and implementing new concepts quickly, combining knowledge from different domains to create new ideas, and take a data-driven and probabilistic approach to testing and implementing new ideas.</p>\n<p>&gt; Team Mindset - We want people who understand 1+1 &gt; 2 and are as committed to making the team better through sharing ideas as they are driven to improve their individual performance.</p>\n<p>&gt; Mental Flexibility &amp; Self Awareness - You\u2019ll have to frequently adapt based on new data, results, and feedback on your trading ideas and your performance.</p>\n<p>&gt; Orientation for Making Money - Although we value academic training, our work is not an academic exercise. We take a hacker\u2019s approach to testing ideas, dropping projects that consume time without high upside, and focusing our next efforts on what will create the most value for the firm.</p>\n<h2><strong>Research / Quant trading strategy skills to have or develop</strong></h2>\n<p>&gt; Strong intuition and deep thinking with data sets - experience working with large, noisy data sets</p>\n<p>&gt; Familiarity with classical statistical methods and knows when and how to apply them in a rigorous fashion; Easily learns how to apply new statistical methods; will seek out and learn new methods to better solve problems</p>\n<p>&gt; Constantly questions finance/trading data and stays motivated to seek answers despite most often proving that there is no correlation or signal</p>\n<p>&gt; Experience in setup of research framework and execution of projects</p>\n<p>&gt; Understanding of financial products, market dynamics, and microstructure</p>\n<p>&gt; Low-level computer languages like C++ or Python, Java, etc.; awareness of strength in particular language and ability to solve more complex problems due to understanding nuances of the language</p>\n<p>_______</p>\n<p><strong><em>* Please submit your CV/Resume &amp; Transcripts (UG - unofficial copy is okay) to university@radix-trading.com to apply</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>**We will eventually require 2+ academic recommendation letters, but these are not required to apply upfront.

We use AI to simulate potential health outcomes for individual patients. Today, we are reimagining the randomized control trial (RCT) for the 21st century through AI-powered clinical trials or TwinRCT. A TwinRCT allows more trial patients to receive the experimental treatment, reaches full enrollment faster and put patients first. Unlearn\u2019s innovative work in AI today will reinvent how AI is applied in medicine tomorrow\u2014and we have a <a>top secret plan</a> for how to get there. We won\u2019t be able to achieve this mission just by applying technologies created by others; the future must be invented.<br/>Unlearn is a technology company, not a biotech company. We use computers, not pipettes. We make and use software, we don\u2019t discover or make drugs. We believe that AI will define the future of medicine, and we aren\u2019t deterred by naysayers or skeptics.\u00a0<br/>We come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from machine learning to marketing\u2014but regardless of where we come from, Unlearners share some common traits:<br/>&gt;&gt; Unlearners are ambitious; we aren\u2019t intimidated by big, challenging goals.\u00a0&gt;&gt; Unlearners are disciplined experimenters; we break down our big goals into smaller chunks and meet as often as  necessary to track our velocity and iterate quickly.\u00a0&gt;&gt; Unlearners are gritty; we never give up, setbacks just make us try harder.&gt;&gt; Unlearners are receptive to new ideas; in fact, we hate being stuck with the status quo.\u00a0&gt;&gt; Unlearners are storytellers; sharing information with each other and with the world is super important, too               important to be boring.\u00a0 And, last but not least,&gt;&gt; Unlearners are team-oriented; we put the mission first, the company second, the team third, and individuals last.<br/>Founded in 2017 by a team of world-class machine learning scientists, we have raised venture capital from top tier investors such as Insight Partners, Radical Ventures, 8VC, DCVC, and DCVC Bio.

We create digital twins of participants in clinical trials and strive to make these twins indistinguishable from real humans. In order to do this, we find that models from the literature are not enough and we need to continually invent new models for our applications. We then dive deep into our models in order to productionize them for clinical trials.
